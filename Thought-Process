Wanting to challenge myself, I decided to try CentOS rather than Rocky or Fedora. 

Though this provided it's own challenges. I initially selected CentOS 7 and began working my way through, learning that apt doesn't work and it instead used yum, and the fact that it didn't come with nano
made it a bit harder than I thought -- that being said, I have gotten pretty proficient with using VIM through my trials and errors.

But it wasn't that way at first! I installed both nano and wget so I would have some familiar commands, though in trying to make it more like Ubuntu, I wwas neglecting any benefit that this distro could have in a way.

After updating my system, I began to work through the same steps as I had with the Ubuntu distro, but was constantly facing issues using Apache (httpd in CentOS)! I'd get Apache, PHP, and MariaDB all set up and seemingly
working but then out of nowhere the command systemctl status httpd would always return with not running and a littany of errors. Uninstalling it, reinstalling it, disabling it, trying everything I can â€”and it just  
wasn't wanting to cooperate.

I completely deleted the VM multiple times, once even going to CentOS 8, hoping for a slightly easier time before hopping on a discord for the CentOS 7 and learning about nginx and it seemed to be the 
solutuion I was looking for.


...and while I presume this is going to cause it's own issues coming up for part 3 (I have no problem going through and forcing Apache/httpd instead of my solution) this seemed a more streamlined method.

The slight differences in the commands constantly threw me, with even how to access MariaDB/MySQL being close but just different enough.
In the end, I got the site up and running, customized it to my liking, and am eager to make the two that I've made so far connect.
